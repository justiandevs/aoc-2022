# Advent of Code - 2022
This is my repository for each Advent of Code 2022 challenge. Each day has its own directory (like ```day1``` for day 1). And inside every directory is a ```.ts``` file (I made everything using TypeScript), a compiled ```.js``` file (compiled everything from TypeScript to JavaScript for testing) and a file in the form of day-number-input.txt like ```day-1-input.txt``` with my personal input inside from the day that belongs to it.

To test my solutions you can clone my repository and run the ```.js``` file that belongs to that day. If you want you can also easily change my input to your own input in ```day-numberofday-input.txt```.

All my solutions are made in TypeScript as told. And at this moment I try my best to make the most performant, well readable code for each solution. At the end readable code is more important for me than the performance of it, since every dataset is so small that performances doesn't really matter in my opinion.

I learned a lot of things of new things when I did the challenges, below a short overview of the things I learned:

| day   | what did I learn                                                                                                                                                                 |

| day 4 | How overlapping works, how to check if something overlaps or not ([1,3] does not overlap with [4,5] for example), how to check if a selection is inside another whole selection  |
| day 5 | Parsing of more complex inputs with tranposing of stacks, deep copies in TypeScript                                                                                              |
